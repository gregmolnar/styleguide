## Naming

* Context aware.
* Namespaced/grouped by theme.
* Should include adjective to describe intent. e.g. `email_label` instead of `email.label`.
* Avoid generic types, technical terms, and implementation details.
* Nesting should be kept to a minimum.
* Sub-genres are ok. ie. `page.sidebar.title`.
* Re-use existing terms wherever possible. Only introduce when makes sense and not add confusion. ie. `tooltip` and `tip`
* Be specific as possible, even if it means duplication.
e.g.

```
# Bad
form.cancel_action

# Good
new_post.cancel_action
new_page.cancel_action
```
